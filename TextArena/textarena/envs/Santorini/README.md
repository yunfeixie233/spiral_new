# Santorini Base Fixed Worker Environment

This is an implementation of the Santorini board game supporting 2-3 players with fixed initial worker positions.

## Game Description

Santorini is an abstract strategy game where players build towers and try to climb to victory. Players take turns moving one of their workers and then building a level on an adjacent space.

### Components
- 5x5 grid board
- Building levels (0-3) and domes
- Two workers per player
- Supports 2-3 players

### Initial Setup
Fixed worker positions optimized for balanced gameplay:

2 Players:
- Player 0 (Navy): C2, B3
- Player 1 (White): D3, C4

3 Players:
- Player 0 (Navy): C3, B3
- Player 1 (White): D3, B4
- Player 2 (Grey): D2, D4

### Turn Structure
On your turn, you must:
1. Move one worker to an adjacent space (including diagonals)
2. Build one level on an adjacent space to where you moved

### Movement Rules
- Can move to any of the 8 adjacent spaces
- Can move up one level
- Can move down any number of levels
- Cannot move up more than one level
- Cannot move to occupied spaces
- Cannot move to spaces with domes

### Building Rules
- Build in any of the 8 spaces adjacent to the moved worker
- Build one level at a time (0→1→2→3)
- Place a dome (4) on level 3 to complete the tower
- Cannot build on occupied spaces or completed towers

### Winning
- Win by moving a worker up to level 3
- Win if next player has no legal moves

## Usage

### Action Format
Actions should be in the format: `[worker_id source dest build]`
where worker_id is N1/N2 for Navy, W1/W2 for White, or G1/G2 for Grey.

Example:
- `[N1C2C3B3]` - Move Navy worker 1 from C2 to C3 and build at B3
- `[W2D3E3E4]` - Move White worker 2 from D3 to E3 and build at E4

Legend:
- Numbers (0-3): Building levels
- 4: Dome (completed tower)
- N1,N2: Navy player's workers
- W1,W2: White player's workers
- G1,G2: Grey player's workers (3-player game only)

## Implementation Notes

This is a simplified version that:
- Uses fixed initial worker positions optimized for balanced gameplay
- Has no worker placement phase
- Does not include God Powers

Future versions may add:
- Worker placement phase
- Support for 4 players
- God Powers
