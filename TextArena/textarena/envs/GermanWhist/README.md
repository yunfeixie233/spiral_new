# GermanWhist Environment Documentation

## Overview

**GermanWhist** simulates the classic 2-player trick-taking card game *German Whist*. Players compete over 26 tricks in two phases. During the first 13 tricks, players draw cards after each trick—one face-up for the winner and one face-down for the loser. The final 13 tricks are played without draws, using the hands formed during the first half.

The player who wins the majority of tricks (14 or more) wins the game.


## Gameplay

- **Players:** 2
- **Deck:** Standard 52-card deck
- **Trump Suit:** Chosen at the start by revealing the top card of the deck
- **Phases:**
  - **Learning Phase (First 13 tricks):** Draws occur after each trick
  - **Endgame Phase (Last 13 tricks):** No more draws; tricks directly contribute to win


## Trick Rules

- The leader plays a card, then the follower responds
- You must **follow suit if you can**
- If both players follow suit, the higher-ranked card wins
- If one player cannot follow suit, they may play any card:
  - A **trump card beats any non-trump**
  - Among trump cards, highest trump wins
