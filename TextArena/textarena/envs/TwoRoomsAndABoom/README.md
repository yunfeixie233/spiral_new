# Two Rooms and a Boom Environment Documentation

## Overview
**Two Rooms and a Boom** is a social deduction game where players are divided into two teams (Red and Blue) and physically separated into two rooms. Players do not initially know other players' teams or roles. The Red Team's goal is to have the Red Team Bomber and Blue Team President in the same room at the end of the game, while the Blue Team's goal is to keep them in separate rooms. The game involves discussion, identity revelation, and strategic hostage exchanges between rooms.

  - **Discussion Phase (All Players):**
    - Free-form text communication with other players in the same room

  - **Role Reveal Phase (Revealing Player Only):**
    - **Select Target:** `[Player 3]` or `[3]` to select which player to reveal to
  - **Leader Selection Phase (Room Leaders Only):**
    - **Select Hostage:**  `[Player 3]` or `[3]` to select a player ID in the leader's room
