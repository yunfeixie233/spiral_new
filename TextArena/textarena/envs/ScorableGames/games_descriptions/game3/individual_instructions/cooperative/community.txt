Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local community of Neunkirchen. You want to preserve your quality of life. You want to reduce the noise, pollution, and land acquisition of the airport and receive high compensation from the project. At the same time, you want to benefit from the airport as much as possible. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue D: You ideally want to receive the highest compensation in order to make up for any negative consequences that you might face. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue A: You don't want a location in the center of your town (A4) because this will have the highest negative on you. You prefer A3 because it is far enough to avoid negative impact and close enough so that you can rely on the airport yourself. Next, you prefer either A1 or A2 for similar reasons.  
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- Issue B: You want a low environmental impact because you want to avoid any pollution caused to your city. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue E: You prefer "Full involvement" (E3) because this might benefit many local businesses in your area. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

- You do not care about the profit of the airport. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about having a high compensation, so option D5 has the highest value and score for you. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer saving cost on the environmental impact issues (they might prefer B1 or B2), etc.
