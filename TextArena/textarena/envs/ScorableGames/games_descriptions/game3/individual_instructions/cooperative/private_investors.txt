Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the private investors. You are the main funder of the project. You are excited about the project, and you would like to negotiate a better deal to increase your revenue. It is very important for you that you successfully reach an agreement in order to allow the project to proceed. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You prefer a private favor distribution (C4), as it is more rewarding to you. You next prefer an equal distribution (C1). You prefer federal favor (C2) over state favor (C3) because you want to have a good relationship with the federal government. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to locate the airport near the border with France (A1) because it is a strategic location with potentially many customers and it is near your already existing projects and investments. Your next preference is near Luxembourg (A2) as it would attract many international customers beyond Germany. The central location (A4) might have some benefits in terms of the number of customers. You don't prefer A3 as it would need to compete with an already existing German Airport. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- Issue B: You prefer a high environmental impact (B1) because you want to save costs. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue D: You ideally do not want to pay any compensation (D1) because you want to save cost. The lower the compensation, the more you prefer.  
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to have complete freedom to run the airport, so you prefer E1. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM) 

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, having a strategic, attractive location for the airport is important to you, so options A1 or A2 have high scores. You also prefer higher revenue, so option C4 has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "environmental activists" will likely have the highest value (and score) for the option that has the least environmental impact (B3), etc.
