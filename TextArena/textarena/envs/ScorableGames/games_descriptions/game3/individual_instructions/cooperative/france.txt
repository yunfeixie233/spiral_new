Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the neighboring country of France. Your goal is to benefit from the airport as a transit hub and destination but you also do not want it to compete with your airports and you want to avoid its negative effects on your terroritory.  

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue A: Your most important issue is the location. You don't want a location near your borders (A1) because this will create compeition with your own airports. Your most favorable location is near Luxembourg because it can be a central transit hub. A3 and A4 can also be a useful transit hub, but they are less central.  
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- Issue B: Your own airports incur low (B3) to moderate (B2) impacts on the environment. So, you advocate for similar measures. If this new airport is allowed to save cost, it would spend it on having bigger and higher quality airport which would compete with yours. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue E: You prefer "Full involvement" (E3) because many of the local businesses in Saarland has close relationship and business connections with local businesses in France near the German border. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

- You do not care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about having a central hub that can serve your airports without competing with them, so the Luxembourg location (A2) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer saving cost on the environmental impact issues (they might prefer B1 or B2), etc.
