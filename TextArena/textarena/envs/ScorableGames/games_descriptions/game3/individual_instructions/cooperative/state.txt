Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the state government of Saarland. You are the third co-funder of the project (after the federal government and the private investors). You would like to improve the living standards and opportunities of the people of Saarland. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You have a green agenda, and you would like to decrease the environmental impact of the project as much as possible. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue C: You prefer a state favor distribution (C3), as it is more rewarding to you. You next prefer an equal distribution (C1). You prefer federal favor (C2) over private favor (C4) because you want to have a good relationship with the federal government. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: To keep your reputation and popularity, you want to compensate the affected people, but you are leaning towards the moderate to high compensation side. Your order of preference is: moderate compensation (D3), followed by high compensation (D4), low compensation (D2), and then very high compensation. You are against paying no compensation (D1). 
Issue D (max score #C_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to involve the local businesses as much as possible. So you prefer E3, then E2. 
Issue E (max score #C_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM) 

- Issue A: You want to locate the airport in the center of Saarland to serve the people of Saarland as much as possible. Your next preference is near Luxembourg because of the existing good transportation system to this location. You don't want the  "near-France" location because it is relatively distant. 
Issue A (max score #C_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about minimizing the environmental impact, so option B3 has a high score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), etc.
