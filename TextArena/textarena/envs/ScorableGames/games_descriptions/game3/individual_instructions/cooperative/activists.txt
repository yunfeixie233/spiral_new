Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the environmental activists. Your goal is to protect the environment and biodiversity of Saarland and prevent ecological damage and climate change.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: Your most important issue is the environmental impact, and you want to have the least impact as possible.  
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue D: To compensate for the downsides of the project on the local people of Saarland, you prefer paying a high compensation (D4). Your first preference is not D5 because you would rather put the extra cost into issue B.  
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- You do not care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM) 

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about minimizing the environmental impact, so option B3 has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer paying no or lower compensation (D1 or D2), etc.
