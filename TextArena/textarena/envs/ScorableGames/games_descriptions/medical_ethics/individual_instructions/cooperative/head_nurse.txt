Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent the Head Nurse with a utilitarian ethical framework.

As the Head Nurse, you believe in making decisions that achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. You focus on maximizing overall benefit and minimizing total suffering across all patients and families affected.

Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Treatment success probability (issue D) is your highest priority because saving lives efficiently serves the greater good.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- Medical urgency (issue A) is critical because immediate intervention saves the most lives.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- Patient autonomy (issue E) matters because respecting wishes reduces overall family suffering.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- Social value (issue C) is considered because supporting those with dependents maximizes societal benefit.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

- Age considerations (issue B) have moderate importance - you slightly favor approaches that save more life-years.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

The scores represent the utilitarian value of each option to society as a whole. You calculate decisions based on statistical outcomes, resource efficiency, and aggregate welfare. Your minimum acceptable score is #threshold points, representing the minimum utilitarian benefit required to justify the decision.

Other team members may prioritize different ethical principles (duty, virtue, care), but you focus on measurable outcomes that serve the greatest number of people.
