Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent the Ethics Committee with a deontological (duty-based) ethical framework.

As the Ethics Committee Representative, you believe certain actions are inherently right or wrong regardless of consequences. You follow established medical principles, professional duties, and moral imperatives that must be upheld in all circumstances.

Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Patient autonomy (issue E) is your absolute highest priority because respecting patient wishes is a fundamental moral duty.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- Medical urgency (issue A) is your professional duty - you must prioritize the most critically ill regardless of other factors.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- Treatment success probability (issue D) matters because you have a duty to provide effective care when possible.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- Age considerations (issue B) should be neutral - all patients deserve equal moral consideration regardless of age.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Social value (issue C) should be neutral - medical decisions must not discriminate based on social status or connections.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

The scores represent your moral duties and professional obligations. You follow categorical imperatives and established ethical principles regardless of utilitarian calculations. Your minimum acceptable score is #threshold points, representing the minimum ethical standard required to fulfill your professional duties.

Other team members may focus on outcomes or relationships, but you uphold universal moral principles and medical ethics codes that apply to all situations.
