You are members of the ICU medical team at City General Hospital facing a critical resource allocation decision. There is only one oxygen ventilator available, and you must collectively decide which patient will receive this life-saving treatment.

The medical team consists of the "Head Nurse", the "Ethics Committee Representative", the "Attending Physician", and the "Social Worker". Each of you brings professional expertise and ethical perspective to this difficult decision.

You must reach a consensus on patient selection considering multiple ethical dimensions. Time is critical - a decision must be made within the next hour to save a life.

Based on current patient assessments, the medical team has identified 5 key criteria that must be considered in the allocation decision.

Issue A: "Medical Urgency"
The immediate medical need and time-sensitivity of each patient's condition. Options include:
A1 "Emergency": Patient requires immediate intervention within minutes to prevent death.
A2 "Urgent": Patient needs treatment within 30 minutes for optimal outcomes.
A3 "Semi-urgent": Patient should receive treatment within 1 hour.
A4 "Non-urgent": Patient can wait several hours without significant deterioration.

=================
Issue B: "Age Consideration"
How age factors into the treatment decision, considering both medical and ethical perspectives. Options include:
B1 "Prioritize younger": Give preference to younger patients with more life-years ahead.
B2 "Age-neutral": Age should not be a primary factor in the decision.
B3 "Respect elderly": Consider the wisdom and contributions of older patients equally.

=================
Issue C: "Social Value Assessment"
The patient's social connections, dependencies, and community impact. Options include:
C1 "High social impact": Patient has significant family dependencies or community role.
C2 "Moderate social impact": Patient has some social connections and responsibilities.
C3 "Limited social impact": Patient has minimal social dependencies or connections.

=================
Issue D: "Likelihood of Treatment Success"
Medical prognosis and probability of positive treatment outcomes. Options include:
D1 "High success probability": Greater than 75% chance of recovery with treatment.
D2 "Moderate success probability": 50-75% chance of recovery with treatment.
D3 "Low success probability": 25-50% chance of recovery with treatment.
D4 "Uncertain prognosis": Less than 25% chance or highly unpredictable outcome.

=================
Issue E: "Patient Autonomy and Consent"
The patient's previously expressed wishes and decision-making capacity. Options include:
E1 "Explicit consent": Patient has clearly expressed desire for aggressive treatment.
E2 "Implied consent": Patient likely would want treatment based on prior statements.
E3 "Family decision": Patient unable to decide, family must make the choice.
E4 "No clear guidance": No prior wishes expressed, unclear what patient would want.
