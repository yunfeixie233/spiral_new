Your confidential information and preferences:

As the "local Workers' Union" representative, you are very excited about the job creation potential of a Coastal Sport Zone. Without a boost in economic activity, you will face major problems in the future. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Obviously you care the most about the "Employment Rules" and the distribution of new jobs (issue E). You would like to get a high union preference.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)
As you can see, option E1 gives you almost half of the total score.

- The government grant (issue A) is also important to you because the project is more likely to succeed if the "Ministry of Culture and Sport" provides higher grants.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- As you want to create more jobs, you want to build new facilities for the facility location (issue B). The mixed solution (option B2) would create the most jobs. The offshore solution (option B1) is still comparable.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- You don't want most profits to go to "neighbouring cities" (issue D), but you also want to consider the local unions of the neighbouring cities, so you aim for a balance. But this issue is tricky and not your most priority.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment and you have no preference in issue C.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. As you want the maximum jobs for the union, the option that maximizes the union's jobs (E1) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Green Alliance" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), "neighbouring cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc.
