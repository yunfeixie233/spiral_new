Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the governor of Aberdeen city. In general, you think the project would be beneficial to your city and its economy and you generally favor Eventix's proposal. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- You believe that the project might not survive in the long-run without substantial grants provided by the "Ministry of Culture and Sport" (issue A).
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- The "local Workers' Union" issue (E) is important to you because of the political strength of the union. You support them in having unlimited preference (option E1)
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- You are not anti-environment, but you think that Eventix's project will be a significant boost to our local economy, so you don't really want to impose high limitations on the facility location (you support option B1 in issue B) or impose high limitations on the environmental impact (you support option C1 in issue C)
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

- As the governor of the city, you don't highly support giving compensations to the neighbouring cities, but you don't want to anger their governors as they are your friends. You would rather avoid upsetting people in this issue.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. As getting a high government grant is an important item to you, the option that has the highest grant (A1) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Green Alliance" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), "neighbouring cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc.
