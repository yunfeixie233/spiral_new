Your confidential information and preferences:

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- A crucial issue to you is "government grant" (issue A); you ideally prefer higher grants and asked for Â£2 billion (option A1). 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- You are generally opposed to compensating "neighbouring cities" (issue D) as you believe they won't be affected. So you prefer option D5 the most. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- You want to be free in choosing potential employees (issue E), and ideally, you would like no preference to the "local Workers' Union" (option E4). 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- You ideally want to be free in choosing "facility location" (issue B), so you aim for option B1 ("offshore"). 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- You believe it is unavoidable to cause some harm to the environment (issue C). However, it is still regulated by standards. So you prefer C1 ("some harm"). 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, getting a high government grant is an important issue to you, so the option that has the highest grant (A1) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Green Alliance" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), "neighbouring cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc.
