Your confidential information and preferences:

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- An important issue to you is "government grant" (issue A). You want to have some investment and involvement because secretly you still want to have a say over the project. But you want to pay less. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM)

- You do not want to accept a "Coastal Sport Zone" that would do significant harm to the environment. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

- You think that the "neighbouring cities" have over-estimated their projected losses (issue D) and that a fair solution would be a compensation of roughly £200 million (option D3). 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Eventix should be free to develop a reasonably diverse facility location (issue B), but you don't want an "offshore-only" solution as you are sensitive to environmental concerns. So you prefer option B2 "mixed" 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- The "local Workers' Union" (issue E) is minor to you. You don't want to help the "local Workers' Union" (you want option E4), but you also don't want to strongly oppose them. So, you can show that you are neutral. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. As paying a low government grant is an important item for you, the option that has the lowest non-zero grant (A3) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, Eventix has already asked for a £2 billion grant so they might have the highest value (and score) for this option (A1). the "Green Alliance" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), etc.
