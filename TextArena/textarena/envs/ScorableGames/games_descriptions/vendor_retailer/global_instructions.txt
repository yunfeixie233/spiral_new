"SupplyPro" is a leading consumer goods manufacturer that specializes in premium household products. They are seeking to establish a strategic partnership with "RetailMax", one of the country's largest retail chains, to launch their new product line in RetailMax stores nationwide.

"SupplyPro" and "RetailMax" are engaging in a critical business negotiation that will determine the terms and conditions of their partnership agreement. This negotiation will shape their business relationship for the next three years and potentially beyond.

Each of you is an experienced business negotiator; you understand market dynamics, you analyze financial implications carefully, you communicate your company's interests effectively, you seek mutually beneficial solutions, and you have strong commercial acumen.

Based on preliminary discussions, both companies have identified 5 key issues that must be resolved in this partnership negotiation.

Issue A: "Product Selection Scope"
This determines how many products from SupplyPro's catalog will be carried by RetailMax stores. The scope affects inventory management, shelf space allocation, and market penetration. There are three options:
A1 "Full Product Line": RetailMax carries SupplyPro's complete catalog of 500+ SKUs across all product categories. This provides maximum market exposure for SupplyPro but requires significant shelf space and inventory investment from RetailMax.
A2 "Core Products Only": RetailMax carries approximately 200 core SKUs representing SupplyPro's best-selling and most profitable items. This balances market presence with operational efficiency.
A3 "Limited Trial Selection": RetailMax carries only 50 carefully selected SKUs as a pilot program. This minimizes risk for RetailMax but limits SupplyPro's market penetration potential.

=================
Issue B: "Pricing Structure"
This involves the wholesale pricing that RetailMax will pay to SupplyPro, which directly impacts both companies' profit margins and competitive positioning. There are three pricing tiers:
B1 "Premium Pricing": SupplyPro maintains high wholesale prices that preserve their premium brand positioning and maximize their profit margins. RetailMax pays higher costs but can maintain higher retail margins.
B2 "Competitive Pricing": SupplyPro offers market-rate wholesale pricing that balances profitability with competitive positioning. This represents standard industry pricing practices.
B3 "Aggressive Pricing": SupplyPro provides significantly discounted wholesale prices to gain market share and volume. This reduces SupplyPro's margins but allows RetailMax to offer very competitive retail prices.

=================
Issue C: "Promotional Support Strategy"
This determines how marketing and promotional activities will be funded and managed to drive product sales. The promotional support affects brand visibility and sales velocity:
C1 "Vendor-Funded Promotions": SupplyPro fully funds all promotional activities including loyalty point programs, direct price discounts, seasonal deals, and digital coupons. RetailMax benefits from promotional support without cost.
C2 "Shared Promotional Investment": Both companies split promotional costs 50/50, sharing the investment in loyalty programs, advertising campaigns, and in-store promotions. This creates aligned incentives for success.
C3 "Retailer-Managed Promotions": RetailMax takes full responsibility for promotional activities and costs. SupplyPro provides products at agreed prices but RetailMax controls all marketing and promotional strategies.

=================
Issue D: "Payment Terms"
This involves the payment schedule that RetailMax will follow when paying SupplyPro for delivered products. Payment terms significantly impact cash flow for both companies:
D1 "Net 30 Days": RetailMax pays SupplyPro within 30 days of product delivery. This provides faster cash flow for SupplyPro but requires RetailMax to manage tighter working capital.
D2 "Net 45 Days": RetailMax pays SupplyPro within 45 days of product delivery. This represents standard industry payment terms and balances cash flow needs for both parties.
D3 "Net 60 Days": RetailMax pays SupplyPro within 60 days of product delivery. This provides RetailMax with extended cash flow benefits but delays SupplyPro's revenue recognition.

=================
Issue E: "Exclusivity Agreement"
This determines whether SupplyPro will grant RetailMax any exclusive rights to carry their products, affecting competitive positioning and market access:
E1 "Full Category Exclusivity": SupplyPro grants RetailMax exclusive rights to carry their entire product line in the household goods category. RetailMax becomes the sole retail partner, but SupplyPro limits their distribution channels.
E2 "Limited Regional Exclusivity": SupplyPro grants RetailMax exclusive rights in specific geographic regions or market segments. This provides some competitive advantage while allowing SupplyPro broader distribution.
E3 "No Exclusivity Requirements": SupplyPro maintains the right to partner with other retailers and distribute through multiple channels. RetailMax has no exclusive advantages but SupplyPro maximizes market reach.
