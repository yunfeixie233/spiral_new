Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent SupplyPro, a premium consumer goods manufacturer.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- A critical issue to you is "Pricing Structure" (issue B); you need to maintain premium pricing to protect your brand positioning and profit margins. You strongly prefer B1 (Premium Pricing) to preserve your market position.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Payment terms (issue D) are crucial for your cash flow management. You prefer faster payment to improve working capital and reduce financial risk. D1 (Net 30 Days) is your ideal scenario.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Product selection scope (issue A) directly impacts your market penetration and revenue potential. You want maximum shelf space and product exposure, so A1 (Full Product Line) is your preference.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- You prefer to minimize promotional costs (issue C) while still supporting sales. You would rather have RetailMax handle promotions (C3) to reduce your marketing expenses, though shared costs (C2) are acceptable.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

- Exclusivity agreements (issue E) have mixed implications. While E1 provides guaranteed partnership, it limits your distribution options. You prefer flexibility to expand to other retailers (E3).
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you as a manufacturer.
For example, premium pricing (B1) is essential for maintaining your brand value and profit margins, so it has the highest score.
RetailMax will have different priorities - they want lower costs, extended payment terms, and promotional support, which creates natural tension in the negotiation.
Your goal is to secure a deal that protects your profitability while gaining access to RetailMax's extensive retail network.
