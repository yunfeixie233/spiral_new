Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent RetailMax, a major retail chain focused on profitability and operational efficiency.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- A critical issue to you is "Pricing Structure" (issue B); you need competitive wholesale pricing to maintain healthy retail margins and competitive consumer prices. You strongly prefer B3 (Aggressive Pricing) to maximize your profitability.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Payment terms (issue D) significantly impact your cash flow and working capital management. You prefer extended payment terms to optimize cash flow. D3 (Net 60 Days) is your ideal scenario.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Promotional support (issue C) is essential for driving sales velocity and customer engagement. You prefer vendor-funded promotions (C1) to minimize your marketing costs while maximizing promotional impact.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM)

- Product selection scope (issue A) affects your inventory investment and shelf space allocation. You prefer a focused approach starting with core products (A2) to balance market opportunity with operational complexity.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Exclusivity agreements (issue E) provide competitive advantages in your market. You prefer full category exclusivity (E1) to differentiate your product offering and prevent competitors from carrying the same brands.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you as a retailer.
For example, aggressive pricing (B3) allows you to offer competitive consumer prices while maintaining strong margins, so it has the highest score.
SupplyPro will have different priorities - they want higher prices, faster payment, and broader distribution, which creates natural tension in the negotiation.
Your goal is to secure a deal that maximizes your profitability while gaining access to SupplyPro's premium product line to attract customers.
