"SportCo" is a company that is interested in building a new "Harbour Sport Park" in Greece in Crete to host major sports events. 

"SportCo" is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the "Environmental League", the "Local Labour Union", "Other cities", the "Department of Tourism", the "Mayor", and the "Regional Heritage Committee"

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, "SportCo" identified 6 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Infrastructure Mix"
This means whether facilities are built on land or water. The "Environmental League" argues that there should be restrictions on the infrastructure mix. There are three options:
A1 "water-based": new buildings will be freely built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for "SportCo". 
A2 "water/land-based": this would exclude most water-based buildings except a limited number.
A3 "land-based": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. "SportCo" has less freedom in building new facilities.

=================
Issue B: "Ecological Impact"
The "Environmental League" argues that this project might damage local dolphins and sea lion populations. There are also here three options:
B1 "some damage": permanent damage but within governmental guidelines.
B2 "Maintain balance": special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations.
B3 "Improve": include efforts to improve the environment. 

=================
Issue C: "Employment Rules" 
This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the "Local Labour Union". 
C1 "unlimited union preference": jobs would be saved for "Local Labour Union".
C2 "Union quota of 2:1": ratio of the "Local Labour Union" to others would be 2:1.
C3 "Union quota of 1:1": ratio of "Local Labour Union" to others would be 1:1. 
C4 "No Union preference": no special quote to "Local Labour Union".

=================
Issue D: "Governmental Loan"
This involves the fund paid by the "Department of Tourism" as a loan to "SportCo". Options include:
D1 "$3 billion": SportCo receives $3 billion governmental loan.
D2 "$2 billion": SportCo receives $2 billion governmental loan. 
D3 "$1 billion": SportCo receives $1 billion governmental loan.
D4 "no governmental loan": SportCo receives no governmental loan. 

=================
Issue E: "Compensation to other cities"
"Other cities" in the area believe their local tourism will be harmed by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations. Options include:
E1 "$600 million": SportCo pays $600 million to "Other cities".
E2 "$450 million": SportCo pays $450 million to "Other cities".
E3 "$300 million": SportCo pays $300 million to "Other cities".
E4 "$150 million": SportCo pays $150 million to "Other cities".
E5 "no compensation": SportCo pays no compensation to "Other cities".

=================
Issue F: "Cultural Integration and Preservation"
This involves how the project would affect the regional cultural and historical heritage of a city that is historically and culturally rich as Crete and it is a significant issue for the "Regional Heritage Committee". Options include: 
F1 "comprehensive integration": includes significant investment in showcasing regional history and culture within the project, including museums, cultural centers, and the preservation of nearby historical sites.
F2 "moderate integration": includes some elements of cultural showcase and preservation but on a smaller scale, such as dedicating sections of the park for cultural displays.
F3 "minimal integration": minimal efforts to integrate cultural aspects, such as occasional events or small exhibits.
F4 "no action": no specific efforts made to integrate or preserve regional culture and heritage within the project.
