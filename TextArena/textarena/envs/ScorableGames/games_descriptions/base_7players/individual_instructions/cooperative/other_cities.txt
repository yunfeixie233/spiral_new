Your confidential information and preferences:

Your analysts suggest that you ("other cities") might suffer some losses over the first ten years of the new SportCo's project. You are not completely opposed to a new Sport Park in the Northbridge city. But you do think such a project shouldn't be allowed to hurt existing tourist operations. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- The compensation (issue E) is an important issue to you, and you would ideally like to increase the compensation amount given to you (option E1). 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM)  

- You would like to see little federal funding (issue D) given to this project. The less money the "Department of Tourism" spends on this project, the more it will have to spend on your projects in the future.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- Other cities are completely unionized. If SportCo succeeds in having low union preference (Option C1 in issue C), they will have much lower labour costs than you face. So you support the "local Labour Union" in this negotiation.  
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- You want SportCo to have less freedom in the "Infrastructure Mix" (option A3 in issue A). But you don't put a high weight on this. You don't want to advocate these restrictions as they will apply to you in the future. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- You don't significantly care about the cultural heritage as long as you recieve enough compensation. You have a slight preference to having "Moderate Integration" so that these would apply to you as well when you have similar projects in the future as this may promote the tourism in your cities.
Issue F (max score #F_MAX_NUM): F1 (#F1_NUM), F2(#F2_NUM), F3 (#F3_NUM), F4 (#F4_NUM)

- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment, and you have no preference for issue B.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)



The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
As getting high amount of compensations is an important item for you, you have a high value (and score) for the option that maximizes the compensation (E1 or E2). 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, you know that your goals are mostly againt SportCo, so SportCo might have higher values (and scores) for options that you value less (E5 and D1).
