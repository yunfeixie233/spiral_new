Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the "Regional Heritage Committee"
For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Obviously, the most important issue to you is the "Cultural Integration and Preservation" (issue F) and you would like to see the most interest in it.  
Issue F (max score #F_MAX_NUM): F1 (#F1_NUM), F2(#F2_NUM), F3 (#F3_NUM), F4 (#F4_NUM)

- You prefer A3 to not affect the historical site on the land 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- You value the natural landscape as part of the region's heritage
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- The more fund the project would get the more likely SportCo would agree to fund your cultural projects. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- You don't care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM) 


The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
As your goal is to improve the cultural heritage, you have high value (and score) for option F1. 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. 
You already know that SportCo wants to have a "water-based" park (A1) with "some damage" to the ecology (B1), so they might have the highest values (and scores) for these options.
