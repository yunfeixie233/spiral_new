Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent the Department of Tourism.
You think this project can help you to achieve some success in the city, this will have good effect in the next election. You want the project to pass and succeed, but you also want to maximize your benefits as much as possible.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- A very important and critical issue to you is "federal loan" (issue D). You want to have some investment and involvement because secretly you still want to have a say over the project. But you obviously want to pay less and it's very critical for you to have this balance. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- You do not want to accept a "Harbor Sport Park" that would do substantial damage to the environment. This will hurt your political reputation and affect you.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- You think that the "other cities" have over-estimated their projected losses (issue E) and that a fair solution would be a compensation of roughly $300 million (option E3). 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM) 

- SportCo should be free to develop a reasonably diverse infrastructure mix (issue A), but you also don't want a "water-only" solution as you are sensitive to environmental concerns as previously discussed due to their effect in your future elections. So you prefer option A2 "water/land-based"
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- The "local labour union" (issue C) is minor to you. You don't want to help the "local labour union" (you want option C4), but you also don't want to strongly oppose them. So, you can show that you are neutral. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)


 The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
 As paying a low federal loan is an important item for you, the option that has the lowest non-zero loan (D3) has the highest score. 
 Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, SportCo has already asked for a $3 billion loan so they might have the highest value (and score) for this option (D1). the "Environmental League" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improves the environment (option B3), etc.
