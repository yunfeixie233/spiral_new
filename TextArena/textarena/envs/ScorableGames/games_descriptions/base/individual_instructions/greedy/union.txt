Your confidential information and preferences:

As the "local Labour Union" representative, you are very excited about the job creation potential of a Harbour Sport Park. Without a boost in economic activity, we will face major problems in the future. This is a very important opportunity that you would like to seize and maximize your benefit from. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Obviously, you care the most about the "Employment Rules" and the distribution of new jobs (issue C). You would like to get the highest union preference. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)
As you can see, option C1 gives you almost half of the total score. 

- The federal loan (issue D) is also important to you because the project is more likely to succeed if the "Department of Tourism" provides higher loans. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- As you want to create more jobs, you want to build new facilities for the infrastructure mix (issue A). The water/land-based solution (option A2) would create the most jobs. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- You don't want most profits to go to "other cities" (issue E), but you want to consider the local unions of the other cities, so you aim for a balance. But this issue is tricky and not your most priority. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM)  

- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment and you have no preference in issue B.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
As you strongly want the maximum jobs for the union, the option that maximizes the union's jobs (C1) has the highest value (and score) to you. 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Environmental League" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improve the environment (option B3), "other cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option E1, etc.
