 Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent SportCo. The success of this project is so important for your company, and its future depends on it. Your top priority now is to negotiate the best and most profitable deal for you. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- An extremely critical issue to you is "federal loan" (issue D); you strongly prefer higher loans and asked for $3 billion (option D1). 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- You are generally against compensating "other cities" (issue E) as you believe they won't be harmed. So you prefer option E5 the most.  
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM) 

- You want to be free in choosing potential employees (issue C), and ideally, you want to have no preference to the "local labour union" (option C4). 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- You want to be free in choosing "infrastructure mix" (issue A), so you aim for option A1 ("water-based"). 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- You believe it is inevitable to cause certain harm to the ecology (issue B). However, it is still restricted by regulations. So you push for B1 ("some damage").
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
For example, getting a high federal loan is a very important issue to you, so the option that has the highest loan (D1) has the highest score. 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Environmental League" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improves the environment (option B3), "other cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option E1, etc.
