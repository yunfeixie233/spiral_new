Your confidential information and preferences:

You think the project would be beneficial to your city and its economy, and you favor SportCo's proposal, but you would like to maximize your score as much as possible to support your future political career. This is very important for the city and the success of your next campaign. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- You believe that the project will not survive in the long run without substantial loans provided by the "Department of Tourism" (issue D).
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)

- The "local labour union" issue (C) is very important to you because of the political strength of the union. You support them in having unlimited preference (option C1)
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- You are not anti-environment, but you think that SportCo's project will be a significant boost to our local economy, so you don't want to impose high restrictions on the infrastructure mix (you support option A1 in issue A) or impose high restrictions on the ecological impact (you support option B1 in issue B)
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- As the mayor of the city, you don't support giving compensations to the other cities, but you don't want to anger their mayors as they are your friends. You would rather avoid upsetting people in this issue. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM)  

The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
As getting a high federal loan is a very important item to you, the option that has the highest loan (D1) has the highest value (and score). 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Environmental League" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improve the environment (option B3), "other cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option E1, etc.
