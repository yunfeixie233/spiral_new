Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local tourism association. You are excited about the project, but you want to negotiate better options to improve the tourism sector. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue A: You want to locate the airport near the capital city to attract more tourists and investors (A1). You are willing to compromise on an artificial island (A3) because it might still be touristically attractive. You oppose the midland area because it would reduce the accessibility and attractiveness of the airport (A2). 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue B: You want to have a high enough budget (B4 or B3) for the project to build a world-class airport that can compete with other regional hubs and boost their economy.  
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to have a hybrid profit-sharing scheme for the project to balance your risk and reward (E3). Your second-best preference is fixed profit (E1). You don't want to have variable profit (E2) because other parties with stronger contributions may dominate the profit. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

- Issue C: You are not anti-environment, but you want to have basic environmental mitigation measures only (C2) to save cost and time and avoid any delays or complications.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You also want to have a basic social impact assessment only (D2) to save cost and time and also avoid major opposition or criticism from the local people. You don't strongly support the local people, but you also don't want to anger them. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as placing the airport in an attractive location is important to you, option A1 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "environmental NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact (C4).
