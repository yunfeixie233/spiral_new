Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the government and you think this project is important to boost the economy of the island. You want to ensure its success and impact on the nation.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences, by order of importance to you, are:

- Issue B: You want to have a high budget (B4 or B3) to build a world-class airport that can compete with other regional hubs and boost your economy.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to have a variable profit-sharing scheme (E2) because you are the main contributor, you also want to incentivize other parties to cooperate and perform well. You think the fixed scheme because would limit your potential gain and reduce your bargaining power.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to locate the airport near the capital city (A1) to attract more tourists and investors, but you are willing to compromise on an artificial island (A3). You don't prefer A2 because of its unattractive location. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue C: You want to have no or minimal environmental mitigation measures (C1 or C2) to save cost and time and avoid any delays or complications.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You want to have no or basic social impact assessment (D1 or D2) to save cost and time.
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, getting a high budget is an important issue to you, so the option that has the highest budget (B4) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "environmental NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduces the environmental impact (C4), the "indigenous communities" might prefer D5 that gives them the highest compensation and involvement, etc.
