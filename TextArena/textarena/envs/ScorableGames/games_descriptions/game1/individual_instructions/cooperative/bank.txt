Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the international bank and want to support projects that are feasible and sustainable and that contribute to the social and environmental well-being of the host country. But you also want to avoid any conflicts or controversies with other parties that might jeopardize your credibility and reputation.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You prefer a moderate budget (B3). A very low budget (B1) might risk the project's feasibility. A high budget (B4) might cause a debt crisis by the island government. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue C: You ideally want to have advanced environmental mitigation measures (C4) to protect the ecological integrity and comply with your green development agenda.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You ideally want to want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to respect the rights and interests of the local people. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue A: You ideally want to locate the airport on an artificial island (A3) to minimize the environmental and social impact. You oppose the coastal area (A1) due to the environmental concerns and the consequences on the indigenous  community.   
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to have a fixed profit-sharing scheme (E1) to reduce the risk, but you do not care much about the profit generated by the project, as long as you can get your loan repaid with interest.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, paying a moderate budget is an important issue to you to ensure the project's feasibility and minimize the risk, so option (B3) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "government" might prefer to minimize the cost and increase its profit, so they might prefer no environmental mitigation (C1), etc.
