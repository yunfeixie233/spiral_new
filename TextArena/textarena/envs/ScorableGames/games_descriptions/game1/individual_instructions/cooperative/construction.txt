Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the construction company. You want to maximize your profit and minimize the cost of the project. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You think it is important to have a high budget (B4 or B3) to increase your profit margin and quality standard by using your advanced technology and equipment. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue A: You prefer locating the airport at the midland city (A2) because it has easier construction conditions, which will increase the efficiency of the project. Your next preference is locating the airport near the capital city (A1) because it has good infrastructure. Your least preferred option is locating the airport on an artificial island (A3) due to the technical challenges.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue E: You want to have either a variable (E2) or hybrid profit-sharing schemes (E3) because you think you are a main contributor to the project.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

- Issue C: You want to have basic or no environmental mitigation measures (C2 or C1) to save cost and time and avoid any delays or complications.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You want to have basic social impact assessment (D2) to save cost and time and also avoid any opposition or criticism from the local people. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as getting a high budget is important to you, option B4 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "environmental NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact (C4).
