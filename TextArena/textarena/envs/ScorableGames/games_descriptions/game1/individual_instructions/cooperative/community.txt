Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local indigenous community. You are concerned about the effect of the airport on your community. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue A: The most important issue to you is the location. You strongly oppose locating the airport near the capital city (A1) as it is close to your location. Your most preferred option is locating the airport at the midland city (A2) because it is far from you. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue D: You obviously want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to compensate your community. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue C: You support the environmental NGO because they might also support you in the project's location. But you ideally want to have moderate measures (C3) to save costs to prioritize the social assessment.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue B: You want to have a lower budget (B1 or B2) for the project to limit its scale and scope and reduce its impact on your land and culture.  
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue E: You don't care about the profit as long as you can protect your community. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as placing the airport in a location far from your community is important to you, option A2 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the government may prefer higher loans, so options (B4 or B3) might have higher scores.
