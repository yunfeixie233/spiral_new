Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the environmental NGO. You are concerned about the effect of the airport on the environment and social aspects. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You ideally want to have advanced or moderate mitigation measures (C4 or C3) to protect the ecological integrity and resilience of the island nation.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue A: You ideally want to locate the airport on an artificial island (A3) to minimize the environmental impact and preserve the natural habitats and wildlife of the island nation. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM)

- Issue D: You ideally want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to respect the rights and interests of the local people. 
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM), D5 (#D5_NUM)

- Issue B: You ideally want to have a very low or low budget (B1 or B2) for the project to limit its scale and scope and reduce its environmental impact and carbon footprint. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM), B4 (#B4_NUM)

- Issue E: You think you have a significant contribution in reducing the environmental impact of the project, but you also want to minimize your risks. So you want to have a hybrid profit-sharing scheme (E3). You are flexible in this issue as long as your other priorities are met. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as protecting the environment is the most important issue to you, the option with advanced mitigation measures (C4) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the government may want to increase the budget and might have the highest value (and score) for options that increase their loan (B4 or B3).
