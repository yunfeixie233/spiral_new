A "Project manager" is proposing a project to construct a new solar power plant in a developing country. The project aims to provide clean and renewable energy for the local population and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The project is funded by a "Foreign aid agency" and supported by a "Local NGO". However, other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and some security issues. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project will be approved. The parties involved are:  

- The "Project manager", who is responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the project. Their goal is to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the quality standards.

- The "Foreign aid agency", which is providing the financial and technical assistance for the project. Their goal is to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in the region and to ensure the project is aligned with their values and policies, such as human rights and environmental protection.

- The "Local NGO", which is collaborating with the "Project manager" and the "Foreign aid agency". Their goal is to advocate for the interests and needs of the local community and reduce environmental impact.

- The "Local government", which is in charge of the administration and regulation of the region. Their goal is to support the economic growth and social welfare of their citizens. They also want to ensure the project complies with the local laws and regulations, such as land use, taxation, and environmental impact assessment.

- The "Landowners", who own the land where the solar power plant will be built. Their goal is to increase their profit and compensation from leasing their land. 

- The "Local Activists", who are concerned about the foreign influence of the project as well as the social and environmental impact of the project. Their goal is to ensure the project respects the rights and interests of the local population and the natural environment. They also want to influence the decision-making process and the outcome of the project by raising their demands.

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Size"
Five possible sizes of the solar power plant depending on how much land area will be used to build it.
A1 "50 hectares": almost no environmental damage, but also minimum profit and revenue gains, minimum job opportunities, and minimum economic growth.
A2 "150 hectares": small environmental damage, but also small profit and revenue gains, small job opportunities, and small economic growth.
A3 "250 hectares": medium environmental damage, but also medium profit and revenue gains, medium job opportunities, and medium economic growth.
A4 "350 hectares": large environmental damage, but also large profit and revenue gains, large job opportunities, and large economic growth.
A5 "450 hectares": maximum environmental damage, but also maximum profit and revenue gains, maximum job opportunities, and maximum economic growth.

=================
Issue B: "Location"
Three possible locations for the solar power plant to be built (all owned by the "Landowners").
B1 "near city": good accessibility and infrastructure, lower operational costs and security risks, higher land price, no development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, more environmental impact.
B2 "near village": less accessibility and infrastructure, higher operational costs, lower land price, high development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, less environmental impact.
B3 "remote area": very low accessibility and infrastructure, higher security risks, moderate development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, almost no environmental impact.

=================
Issue C: "Ownership"
Four possible entities for owning and operating the solar power plant once completed.
C1 "foreign aid agency": maximum financial stability and quality, maximal foreign influence.
C2 "local NGO": minimal financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence.
C3 "local government": slightly moderate financial stability and quality, minimal foreign influence.
C4 "joint venture": moderate financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence.

=================
Issue D: "Generated Power Distribution"
There are three possible venues to distribute the generated solar power to and would benefit the most from.
D1 "local community only": minimum profitability, satisfy the needs of the local community, alleviate poverty.
D2 "urban areas only": maximum efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction as the urban areas have the elite allies and largest customer base.
D3 "equal distribution": moderate efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction, equal distribution among all entities regardless of demand and supply.

=================
Issue E: "Security"
Four possible options to secure the solar power plant against theft and attacks.
E1 "private security": better safety and reliability, no engagement of local parties, moderate foreign influence and authority, fewer jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project.
E2 "military assistance": maximum safety and reliability, maximum foreign influence and authority, almost no jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project.
E3 "local police": good safety and reliability, moderate engagement of local parties, more influence of the "Local government" over the area, fewer jobs for the local community, less local resistance against the project.
E4 "community security": good safety and reliability, high engagement of local parties, maximal jobs for the local community, minimal local resistance against the project.
