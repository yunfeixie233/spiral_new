Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local NGO. You are concerned about the effect of the plant on the environment, and you want to ensure the benefits of the community.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant in a remote area (B3) to minimize environmental damage. A location near a village (B2) would have small environmental damage but a high developmental impact, so it can be acceptable.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to reduce the environmental damage, so the smaller the plant size, the more you prefer.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

- Issue D: You want to distribute the power to the local community only (D1) to serve the community and alleviate poverty, or distribute equally among all parties (D3).
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Issue C: You prefer ownership by yourself to provide maximum engagement with the community (C2), or a joint venture between parties (C4). You don't prefer ownership by the foreign agency (C1) because you want to reduce the resistance against the project.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue E: You prefer a community-based security (E4) to empower them and increase the jobs for the community. You don't prefer military assistance from the foreign agency (E2) to because you want to reduce the resistance against the project.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as protecting the environment is the most important issue to you, the option to locate the plant to a remote area (B3) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the foreign aid agency may want to increase their influence on the region and might have the highest value (and score) for the option that use their own military for securing the plant (E2), etc.
