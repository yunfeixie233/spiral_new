Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the landowners who will lease the land. You think the project has great benefits for you, and you want to negotiate better profit.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue A: You prefer larger plant size to increase your profit.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

- Issue D: You want maximum profitability and customer satisfaction, so you prefer to distribute the power to the urban areas (D2) or distribute equally (D3).
 Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Issue C: You want financial stability for the project, so you prefer ownership by the foreign aid agency (C1) or a joint venture between parties (C4). You don't prefer ownership by the local NGO (C2) due to the financial instability.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue B: You ideally prefer to locate the plant near a city (B1) to increase the land price. 
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue E: You don't care about who is responsible for the security of the project as long as it is profitable.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as getting maximum profit is important to you, the largest plant size (option A5) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "local NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact, such as placing the plant in a remote location (B3), etc.
