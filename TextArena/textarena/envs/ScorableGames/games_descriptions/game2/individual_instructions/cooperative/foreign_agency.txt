Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the foreign aid agency and want to support projects that are feasible and sustainable and that contribute to the sustainable development and poverty reduction of the developing country while keeping influence and authority. You also want to avoid any conflicts or controversies with other parties that might jeopardize the project.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue E: You prefer utilizing your own military assistance to increase safety and reliability while maintaining your influence and authority on the region (E2). A private security (E1) would also be a good option as it provides better safety and reliability than the remaining options.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to balance quality, cost, and environmental impact with a medium-sized plant (A3) or large-sized plant (A4). You do not want to spend too much money or harm the environment with a very large plant (A5).
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

- Issue C: You want financial stability for the project, so you prefer ownership by yourself (C1) or a joint venture between parties (C4). You are collaborating with the NGO, so option C2 might have some value to you. You don't prefer ownership by the local government (C3) because you want to maintain your influence.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You want to distribute the power to the local community only (D1) to serve your goal of poverty alleviation, or alternatively, distribute equally among all parties (D3).
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a village (B2) to boost development to rural areas and poverty alleviation.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, using your own military for security is an important issue to you to ensure the plant's safety and boost your influence, so option (E2) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "government" might prefer to maximize their own influence, so they might prefer utilizing the local police force for security (E3), etc.
