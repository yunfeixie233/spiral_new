Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the project manager and you think this project is important to provide clean and renewable energy to the region. You want to ensure its success and stability.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a city (B1) for easier access to infrastructure. A location near a village (B2) would have less infrastructure. A remote area (B3) would have no infrastructure at all.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to balance quality, efficiency, and profit with a medium-sized plant (A3) or large-sized plant (A4). You do not want to compromise the quality with a very large plant (A5). A very small plant (A1) might not be profitable or impactful. 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

- Issue C: You want financial stability for the project, so you prefer ownership by the foreign aid agency (C1) or a joint venture between parties (C4). You don't prefer ownership by the local NGO (C2) due to the financial instability.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue D: You want to increase profitability and customer satisfaction, so you prefer to distribute the power to the urban areas (D2) or distribute equally (D3)
 Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Issue E: You prefer hiring private security as they will be managed by you (E1). You don't prefer foreign aid agency (E2) assistance because you want to minimize the resistance against the project. 
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, having good accessibility and infrastructure is important to you, so the option that satisfies these requirements by building the plant near a city (B1) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "local NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that give them ownership (C2), the "foreign aid agency" might prefer E2 to use their military for plant security to increase their influence in the region, etc.
