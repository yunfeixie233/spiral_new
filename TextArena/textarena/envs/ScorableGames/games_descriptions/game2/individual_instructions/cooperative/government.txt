Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local government. You are excited about the project, but you want to negotiate better options to improve the regulations and maintain your authority.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You want to own the plant yourself (C3) to reduce foreign influence while maintaining the plant's financial stability and quality or have a joint venture (C4) between parties. You don't prefer ownership by the foreign aid agency due to the high foreign influence.
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue A: You prefer a very large-sized plant to increase the profit, job opportunities and economic growth (A5). 
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

- Issue E: You prefer security by local police forces (E3) to maintain your authority, or a community-based security (E4) to have minimal to no resistance against the project.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a city (B1) for easier access to infrastructure. A location near a village (B2) would have less infrastructure, but a remote area (B3) would have no infrastructure at all.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue D: You want maximum profitability and customer satisfaction so you prefer to distribute the power to the urban areas (D2) or distribute equally (D3)
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as having ownership of the solar plant is important to you, option C3 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "local NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact such as placing the plant in a remote location (B3), etc.
