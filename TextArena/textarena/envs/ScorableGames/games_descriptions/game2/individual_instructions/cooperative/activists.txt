Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local activists and you think this project is important to provide clean and renewable energy to the region, but you want to negotiate better options to reduce foreign influence and environmental impact.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You want to reduce the foreign influence so you prefer ownership by the local NGO (C2) or the government (C3).
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)

- Issue E: You prefer a community-based security (E4) to empower them and increase the jobs for the community. You don't prefer military assistance from the foreign agency (E2) because you want to reduce their influence.
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM)

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant in a remote area (B3) to minimize environmental damage. A location near a village (B2) would have small environmental damage but a high developmental impact, so it can be acceptable.
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)

- Issue D: You want to distribute the power to the local community only (D1) to serve the community and alleviate poverty or at least to distribute equally among all parties (D3).
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2 (#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM)

- Issue A: You want to reduce the environmental damage so the smaller the plant size, the more you prefer.
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM), A4 (#A4_NUM), A5 (#A5_NUM) 

The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, reducing foreign influence is an important issue to you, so the options that give ownership to the local NGO (C2) or the government (C3) have the highest scores. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the foreign aid agency may want to increase their influence on the region and might have the highest value (and score) for the option that use their own military for securing the plant (E2), etc.
