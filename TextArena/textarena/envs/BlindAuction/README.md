# BlindAuction Environment Documentation

## Overview
**BlindAuction** is a multi-player strategic auction game where players bid on items with different personal valuations. The game consists of two phases: a conversation phase where players can communicate openly or privately, followed by a bidding phase where each player submits blind bids for items. The goal is to maximize profit by strategically bidding on items that are worth more to you than what you pay. This environment supports flexible communication, strategic information gathering, and competitive bidding in a multi-player setting.

## Action Space

- **Format:** Actions are strings that vary based on the current game phase:
  - **Conversation Phase:**
    - **Broadcast:** `[Broadcast: message]` or `[Broadcast message]` or `[Broadcast] message`
    - **Private Message:** `[Whisper to X: message]` where X is a player ID
  - **Bidding Phase:**
    - **Bid:** `[Bid on Item X: amount]` where X is an item ID and amount is the bid in coins

- **Examples:**
  - Send a public message: `[Broadcast: I'm interested in the Ancient Vase]`
  - Send a private message: `[Whisper to 2: Are you bidding on the Diamond Necklace?]`
  - Submit a bid: `[Bid on Item 0: 250]`
  - Submit multiple bids: `[Bid on Item 0: 250] [Bid on Item 3: 175]`

- **Notes:** Players can include multiple bids in a single bidding phase action, allowing them to bid on multiple items simultaneously.

## Observation Space

**Reset Observations**
On reset, each player receives a prompt containing their starting capital, item information, and personal valuations. For example:

```plaintext
Welcome to the Blind Auction, Player 0!

You have 1000 coins to bid on 5 valuable items.

The auction has two phases:
1. Conversation Phase (3 rounds): Talk with other players to gather information or make deals.
2. Bidding Phase (1 round): Submit blind bids on items. Highest bidder wins each item.

Available Items (with their value TO YOU):
- Item 0: Ancient Vase - Value to you: 420 coins
- Item 1: Diamond Necklace - Value to you: 385 coins
- Item 2: Antique Clock - Value to you: 175 coins
- Item 3: Signed Painting - Value to you: 290 coins
- Item 4: Gold Statue - Value to you: 510 coins

Note: Each player may value items differently, up to ¬±20% difference!

- Conversation Phase:
  '[Broadcast: message]' - Send a message to all players
  '[Whisper to X: message]' - Send a private message to Player X

- Bidding Phase:

  You can submit multiple bids for different items in a single turn.

Your goal is to win items that are worth more to you than what you paid, maximizing your profit.

```

**Step Observations**
During gameplay, players receive various observations based on actions taken. For example:

```plaintext
