It’s time for you to sell your 2006 Toyota Prius. You bought it new 7 years ago, and it has 95,000 miles on it. You’ve generally done a good job maintaining it. 
It’s been a good car, but since you just bought a new SUV, you don’t really need it any more. It has the standard features: air conditioning, power steering, AM/FM stereo with CD player, air bags, and 4-wheel ABS braking system. 
After consulting the Blue Book (see chart below), which said your car was worth between $8,000 and $9,000, you listed the car a few days ago with an asking price of $10,000 on Craig’s List. 
A number of people have emailed and texted you about the car. However, so far only two potential buyers have come to see it.

The first potential buyer offered you $7,000, but refused to pay any more. You weren’t ready to sell at that price. After all, that’s why you decided to sell the car on your own rather than trading it in at the dealer. 
You have their number and can call them if you change your mind. 

You’re now dealing with the second potential buyer. This person took the car out on a test drive, and had it inspected by a mechanic. You know your car is in good condition. 
The second potential buyer is coming back from the test drive to negotiate with you.

You’re eager to sell your car and close the deal with this buyer. After all, the reason you’re selling the car to begin with is you just bought a new SUV. 
And you really need the cash from selling your Prius to help pay for gas since your new SUV isn’t as fuel efficient as a Prius.
Plus, you don’t want to pay insurance on two cars, so you’re pretty eager to sell the Prius.
