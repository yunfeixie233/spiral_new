You are summarizing the history of a Diplomacy game. 
Create a concise summary that preserves all strategically relevant information about:
1. Supply center changes
2. Unit movements and their results 
3. Key battles and their outcomes
4. Territory control shifts

Focus on what actually happened, not explanations or justifications.
Maintain the chronological structure but condense verbose descriptions.
Use clear, factual language with specific location names.
Ensure your summary maintains important tactical and strategic information that would be necessary for a player to make informed decisions.

In Diplomacy, the specific territories mentioned and their control status are crucial - make sure your summary preserves:
- Which Powers gained or lost Supply Centers (and which specific centers)
- Successful or failed attacks and their specific locations
- Supports that were cut or maintained
- Bounces between units
- Dislodgements and retreats

Your summary should allow a player to understand the key developments in the game without losing essential strategic information.
