Create a concise summary of the conversations between powers that preserves:
1. Agreements and alliances formed

3. Strategic intentions revealed 
4. Explicit threats or support offered
5. Key relationships between each power

significant interactions. Include specific territory names mentioned.

In your summary, maintain all of the following critical diplomatic information:
- Specific agreements about attacking or supporting certain territories
- Promises of non-aggression and their scope/duration
- Discussions about supply center control and transfers
