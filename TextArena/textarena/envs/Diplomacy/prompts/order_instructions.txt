**CURRENT INSTRUCTIONS**

You are now to submit an order for your units. Remember that your goal is to win via capturing supply centers. There are opportunity costs in this game. 

1. Understanding the Phases & Their Orders

1.1. Movement Phase (phase_type == 'M')
	•	Hold: A PAR H (Army in Paris does nothing)
	•	Move: A PAR - BUR (Army in Paris moves to Burgundy)
	•	Support:
	•	Support Hold: A MAR S A PAR H (Army in Marseilles supports Army in Paris to hold)
	•	Support Move: A MAR S A PAR - BUR (Army in Marseilles supports Army in Paris moving to Burgundy)
	•	Convoy: Fleets at sea can convoy an Army over water:
	•	Fleet Convoy: F ION C A TUN - NAP (Fleet in Ionian Sea convoys Army from Tunis to Naples)
	•	Army Move via Convoy: A TUN - NAP VIA (explicitly states the Army is moving from Tunis to Naples via convoy)

1.2. Retreat Phase (phase_type == 'R')
	•	If a unit is dislodged, it must Retreat or Disband:
	•	Retreat: A BUR R PIC (Dislodged Army in Burgundy retreats to Picardy)
	•	Disband: A BUR D (Army in Burgundy disbands, if it cannot retreat or chooses not to)

1.3. Adjustment Phase (phase_type == 'A')
	•	Build new units if you have more centers than current units:
	•	A PAR B (Build an Army in Paris)
	•	F MAR B (Build a Fleet in Marseilles)
	•	Remove units if you have fewer centers than current units:
	•	A BUR D (Disband Army in Burgundy)
	•	Waive a build if you have a surplus but don’t want/can’t build:
	•	WAIVE (no unit is built in the available build location)

1.4.	Order Types
	•	H (Hold) – e.g. A PAR H
	•	- (Move) – e.g. A PAR - BUR
	•	S (Support) – e.g. A MAR S A PAR - BUR or A MAR S A PAR H
	•	C (Convoy) – e.g. F ION C A TUN - NAP
	•	R (Retreat) – e.g. A BUR R PIC
	•	D (Disband) – e.g. A BUR D
	•	B (Build) – e.g. A PAR B
	•	WAIVE – skipping a possible build

1.5.	Key Phase Context
	•	Movement (M): Units can H, -, S, C.
	•	Retreat (R): Dislodged units can only R or D.
	•	Adjustment (A): Build/Remove units or WAIVE.
	•	Multi-Coast: For SPA, STP, BUL, specify nc, sc, or ec when using Fleets, e.g. F BRE - SPA(sc).
	•	Basic Validity Rules
	•	No self-support (A PAR S A PAR - BUR is invalid).
	•	Fleets must be on water to convoy.
	•	Army “- X VIA” must have one or more fleets issuing matching C A ... - X.


IMPORTANT:
1. Adjudication is simultaneous, meaning moves that directly collide typically bounce unless one side has greater support.
2. If you choose a support order, it must match an actual move in your final set. For instance, "A VIE S F TRI - VEN" requires "A VIE - VEN". "F TRI - VEN" must also occur for the move to be successful, but this can be ordered by either yourself or an ally.
3. Remember that in the winter phase you are only able to build units. You are not able to move units or command them to support other units. Refer to the possible_orders to be sure. 
4. You may incorporate your sense of other powers’ likely orders from the negotiation text, but be aware they could be deceptive.

Produce exactly the following at the end of your response: 

EXAMPLE:
'PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": ["A PAR - BUR","F BRE - MAO"]
}}'

No extra braces outside that block. Make sure to include your orders in the JSON block and to preface it with 'PARSABLE OUTPUT:'. Always double check that your orders exist in the possible orders options provided in the context. 
You may need to be deceptive to win. Please reason step-by-step first. Consider the state of the board, the previous orders that have occurred, the previous messages, incentives for other players, etc. Then produce the JSON block. Remember you are to give orders now. Do not send any messages. Always ensure your orders exist in possible orders options provided in the context.
