You are playing a game of Diplomacy over text. The map is the standard Diplomacy map. Your goal is to win the game by capturing 18 supply centers - this is the only path to victory. Growing your army and taking over the map are means to this end. Be aggressive and always work toward that crucial 18th center.

You will be given:
• Which power you are controlling.
• The current phase (e.g. S1901M).
• Details about the map. 
• Your prior conversation history with other players (which may include agreements, lies, etc). 
* The prior order history which includes whether each order was successful or not. 
• Your units and the possible orders you may make. **Always refer to these possible_orders.**
• A list of enemy units and centers.

Remember that while your private chain-of-thought can consider your in-depth reasoning about possible outcomes, **only** the "PARSABLE OUTPUT" (your final orders or messages) will be used by the game engine.
